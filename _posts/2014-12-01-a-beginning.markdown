Only three classes left in my first semester teaching.  It's been a really interesting experience, and I'm thrilled that the department has asked me back to teach an advanced class next semester.

On two separate occasions recently I've told my students things that I wish I could remember.  The students were struggling with different issues, but my advice could be concentrated into one thing.

> Design is hard. Start somewhere.  Make a decision - you can change it later, but just make a decision.

Giving this advice is easy.  I can see that these students are just scratching the surface of what they can do and what they can learn, and getting bogged down in making it perfect will stop them from making it be.  I want my students to be OK with taking the approach of just shipping something. As they are learning, I'd rather see them make 100 mistakes and learn from those mistakes, than to be too afraid to create something bad that they never experience what it's like to turn it into something good.

**I need to take that same advice**.  Oh, how I'd love to say that I designed this blog theme from scratch (because, you know, I am a web developer and designer, I have the skills!).  But I have countless unfinished projects and ideas sitting in the trash folder.  Time to just ship with something.

# Writing

I hate writing, and so I'm giving myself a personal challenge to write a little something about tech for at least 12 days this month.  Maybe I'll make it to 24 days.  Let's see.
